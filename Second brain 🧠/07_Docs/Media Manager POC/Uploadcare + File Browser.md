# Uploadcare POC Analysis: Senior Engineer & Architect Perspective

  

## Executive Summary

  

Based on the analysis of your four scenarios for implementing a file management system with image editing capabilities, this report provides a comprehensive evaluation of Uploadcare's suitability for your requirements, along with alternative approaches and their trade-offs.

  

## 1. Digital Asset Management (DAM) with Folder Management

  

### Current State Analysis

- **Uploadcare Limitation**: Does not natively provide folder management or hierarchical organization

- **Workaround Required**: Implement virtual folders using file metadata or custom UI layer

  

### Recommended Architecture

```

User Interface Layer:

├── File Browser (filebrowser.org) - Folder navigation

├── Custom Integration Layer - Bridges File Browser to Uploadcare

└── Uploadcare Widget - File upload and editing

  

Storage Layer:

├── Azure Blob Storage - Primary file storage

├── Uploadcare Proxy - Image transformation and CDN

└── Custom Database - File metadata and folder mappings

```

  

### Implementation Approach

1. Use **File Browser** for folder management UI

2. Store files in Azure Blob Storage

3. Maintain folder metadata in your database

4. Use Uploadcare Proxy for transformations

  

## 2. Image & Video Editing During Upload

  

### Uploadcare Capabilities Assessment

- **Image Editing**: Excellent (crop, rotate, filters, effects, smart transformations)

- **Video Editing**: Basic (format conversion, thumbnails, basic transformations)

- **Integration**: Angular wrapper available (`ngx-uploadcare-widget`)

  

### Technical Implementation

```javascript

// Angular Integration Example

import { UcWidgetModule } from 'ngx-uploadcare-widget';

  

// Template

<ngx-uploadcare-widget

  images-only="false"

  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"

  effects="crop,rotate,enhance,grayscale">

</ngx-uploadcare-widget>

```

  

### Limitations & Considerations

- Video editing capabilities are limited compared to specialized video platforms

- Advanced video editing may require additional solutions (e.g., Cloudinary)

  

## 3. Email Designer Integration with File Explorer

  

### Architecture Design

```

Email Designer Workflow:

1. User clicks "Insert Image" button

2. Opens custom file browser modal

3. User selects image from Azure Blob folders

4. Integration layer generates Uploadcare Proxy URL

5. User applies transformations via Uploadcare interface

6. Final CDN URL inserted into email template

```

  

### Technical Implementation Strategy

```javascript

// Integration Layer

const insertImageToEmailDesigner = async (filePath) => {

  // Generate Uploadcare Proxy URL

  const proxyUrl = `https://your-subdomain.ucr.io/-/preview/${filePath}`;

  // Open Uploadcare editor for transformations

  const editedUrl = await openUploadcareEditor(proxyUrl);

  // Insert into email designer

  emailDesigner.insertImage(editedUrl);

};

```

  

### Key Requirements

- Custom integration between file browser and email designer

- Real-time preview of transformations

- Seamless URL handling for final insertion

  

## 4. Azure Blob Storage with Uploadcare Proxy Security Analysis

  

### Security Architecture

```

Multi-tenant Security Model:

├── Azure AD Authentication

├── Storage Account per Tenant (Recommended)

├── SAS Token Management

├── Uploadcare Proxy Configuration

└── Custom Permission Layer

```

  

### Security Considerations

  

#### Data Sovereignty

- **Advantage**: Files remain in your Azure infrastructure

- **Requirement**: Uploadcare Proxy must access files via public URLs or SAS tokens

  

#### Multi-tenant Isolation Options

1. **Storage Account per Tenant** (Recommended)

   - Highest isolation level

   - Independent key rotation

   - Scalable but requires management overhead

  

2. **Container per Tenant**

   - Good isolation with shared infrastructure

   - Cost-effective for smaller tenants

   - Simplified management

  

#### Access Control Implementation

```javascript

// SAS Token Generation for Uploadcare Proxy

const generateSASToken = (tenantId, fileName) => {

  const expiryTime = new Date();

  expiryTime.setHours(expiryTime.getHours() + 1); // 1-hour expiry

  return azureStorage.generateSASToken({

    containerName: `tenant-${tenantId}`,

    fileName: fileName,

    permissions: 'r', // Read-only

    expiry: expiryTime

  });

};

```

  

### Security Best Practices

- Implement short-lived SAS tokens (1-2 hours)

- Use Azure AD for user authentication

- Enable Azure Defender for Storage

- Implement audit logging for all file access

- Regular security reviews and penetration testing

  

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

  

### 3-Year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
